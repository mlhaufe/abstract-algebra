# Ring Theory

The study of two operations: `(*)` `(+)` where `(*)` is the grouping operation of
Groupoid and (+) is an operation that describes how distribution of one
operation over another occurs

Distributivity:

```text
a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)
(a + b) * c = (a * c) + (b * c)
```

@see <https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/853690/how-is-addition-different-than-multiplication>
Interesting claim in there that in Binary algebra there is no difference between the two operations irt distribution
